## ABOUT ME

Hi everyone! My name is Tom, and I am an Urban Informatics student. I have degrees in economics and city planning. I am fairly new to coding, so this course should be pretty challenging for me! I am based in Boston, and I've been working at an affordable housing organization for the past 11 years, performing housing policy and data analysis. My hobbies include snowboarding, video games, and drawing. I'm looking forward to working with you all this semester!
